# Welcome and about the course

This slow-paced hands-on course is designed for absolute beginners who want to start using containers to achieve reproducibility of data analysis. <br>
Linux containers allow the storage of code and applications in a host-independent lightweight environment. They became a fast and popular way to share and deploy applications in different environments. <br>

## About the course

### Learning objectives

About Linux containers:

- Locate and fetch Docker/Singularity images from dedicated repositories.
- Execute/Run a Docker/Singularity container from the command line.
- Build a Docker container from an existing recipe.
- Design/Write a Docker recipe.
- Convert Docker to a Singularity image.


### Prerequisite / technical requirements

#### Prerequisite

* Being comfortable working with the CLI (command-line interface) in a Linux-based environment.
* Participants are not expected to have used Linux containers before.

#### Technical requirements

* You should be able to work in a terminal on your machine to access the cloud via ssh:
    * on Linux and Mac operating systems it is there by default.
    * on Windows, you could install a [Windows terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) or an application like [putty](https://www.putty.org/).
<br>
If you are not familiar with the **ssh** protocol, you can learn about it <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ssh-tutorial-how-does-ssh-work" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br>
* You should also be able to use a **command-line/screen-oriented text editor** (such as nano or vi/vim) or to be able to use an editor able to connect remotely like Visual studio, emacs or bbedit. If you are not sure what text editor to use, we recommend that you <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Nano/Basics_Guide" target="_blank">learn the basics of "nano"</a>.
<br>
* During the course, we will use the [**Slack**](https://slack.com) platform for discussion and troubleshooting. You can either [install the Slack app](https://slack.com/intl/en-es/help/categories/360000049043#download-slack) before the course, or you will be able to access Slack from a web browser.
<br>
* We also encourage you to create a [**Github account**](https://github.com/join) and an associated [**Docker hub account**](https://hub.docker.com/signup).

### Dates, time, location

You can find all information in the dedicated course page of the [Moodle platform](https://moodle.crg.eu).

## Program

* Containers: introduction and history.
* Docker hub: find existing containers.
* Fetch (and build) an image from public registries (Docker Hub, Quay.io, etc.)
 * Discover relevant base images
* Run Docker container based on an existing image (also run it interactively).
* Build an image from an existing recipe:
  * Sections and keywords.
  * Build options (e.g. cache or build variables).
* Write a Docker recipe and build an image from it.
* Docker:
  * Work with volumes and ports.
  * Upload image to registries.
* Singularity:
  * Singularity versus Docker.
    * Differences, pros and cons for each system.
  * Fetch (and build) a Singularity images.
    * Build from existing public registries.
    * Build from local Docker instances.
  * Run a Singularity container (interactively).
  * Understanding and working with volumes.
  * Singularity build recipes.
  * Advanced features: services, etc.
