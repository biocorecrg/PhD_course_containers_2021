Course page: https://biocorecrg.github.io/PhD_course_containers_2021/

## About the course

This slow-paced hands-on course is designed for absolute beginners who want to start using containers to achieve reproducibility of data analysis. Linux containers allow the storage of code and applications in an host-independent lightweight environment. They became a fast and popular way to share and deploy applications in different environments.
