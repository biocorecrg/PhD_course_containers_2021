# Introduction to containers

## What are containers ?

A Container can be seen as a **minimal virtual environment** that can be used in any Linux-compatible machine (and beyond).

Using containers is time- and resource-saving as they allow:

* Controlling for software installation and dependencies.
* Reproducibility of the analysis.

Containers allow us to use **exactly the same versions of the tools**.

## Virtual machines or containers ?

| Virtualisation | Containerisation (aka lightweight virtualisation) |
| ----- | ----- |
| Abstraction of physical hardware | Abstraction of application layer |
| Depends on hypervisor (software) | Depends on host kernel (OS) |
| Do not confuse with hardware emulator | Application and dependencies bundled all together |
| Enable virtual machines:<br>Every virtual machine with an OS (Operating System) ||

### Virtualisation

* Abstraction of physical hardware
* Depends on hypervisor (software)
* Do not confuse with hardware emulator
* Enable virtual machines:
	* Every virtual machine with an OS (Operating System)

### Containerisation (aka lightweight virtualisation)

* Abstraction of application layer
* Depends on host kernel (OS)
* Application and dependencies bundled all together

### Virtual machines vs containers

**Pros and cons**

|| Virtualisation | Containerisation |
| :------ | :------------: | :--------------: |
| PROS | Very similar to a full OS. <br> With current solutions, high OS diversity. | No need of full OS installation (less space). <br> Faster than virtual machines. <br> Easier automation. <br> Current solutions allow easier distribution of recipes. <br> Better portability.|
| CONS | Need more space and resources. <br> Slower than containers. <br> Not that good automation. | Some cases might not be exactly the same as a full OS. <br> Still less OS diversity, even with current solutions. |

## History of containers

### chroot

* chroot jail (BSD jail): first concept in 1979
* Notable use in SSH and FTP servers
* Honeypot, recovery of systems, etc.

### Additions in Linux kernel

* First version: 2008
* cgroups (control groups), before "process containers"
	* isolate resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc.) of a collection of processes
* Linux namespaces
	* one set of kernel resources restrict to one set of processes
