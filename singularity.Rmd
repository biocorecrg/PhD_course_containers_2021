## Introduction to Singularity

* Focus:
  * Reproducibility to scientific computing and the high-performance computing (HPC) world.
* Origin: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Later spin-off: Sylabs
* Version 1.0 -> 2016
* More information: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(software)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(software))

### Strengths

* No dependency of a daemon
* Can be run as a simple user
  * Avoid permission headaches and hacks
* Image/container is a file (or directory)
* More easily portable
* Two type of images
  * Read-only (production)
  * Writable (development, via sandbox)


### Weaknesses

* At the time of writing only good support in Linux
  * Mac experimental. Desktop edition. Only running
* For some features you need root account (or sudo) - alternatively using fakeroot option


## Warning

There may be some confusion since there are two projects which the share the same name:

* [HPCng Singularity](https://singularity.hpcng.org/)
* [Sylabs Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/)

They "forked" not long ago. So far they share most of the codebase, but eventually this may different and software could have different functionality.

## Build process

<!-- New image needs to be created based on this -->

### Examples

There are different ways to generate Singularity image files. The most common way is so far thanks to existing Docker images already present in public registries.

#### Through registries

##### Docker Hub

[https://hub.docker.com/r/biocontainers/fastqc](https://hub.docker.com/r/biocontainers/fastqc)

```{bash}
    singularity build fastqc-0.11.9_cv7.sif docker://biocontainers/fastqc:v0.11.9_cv7
```

##### Biocontainers

###### Via quay.io

[https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/fastqc](https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/fastqc)

```{bash}
    singularity build fastqc-0.11.9.sif docker://quay.io/biocontainers/fastqc:0.11.9--0
```

###### Via Galaxy project prebuilt images

```{bash}
    singularity pull --name fastqc-0.11.9.sif https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/fastqc:0.11.9--0
```

```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
Galaxy project provides all Bioinformatics software from Biocontainers initiative as Singularity prebuilt images. If download and conversion time of images is an issue for you, this is likely the best option if working in the biomedical field.
```

##### Singularity catalog

Not as popular so far, but it provides a lot of recipes (to be discussed below)

* [https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-catalog/](https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-catalog/)


#### Docker Daemon

If you create your own images (as we did during the course) and you don't want to share them publicly (and you have not access to any private image registry, either), you can convert your locally built Docker images into Singularity image files.

```{bash}
        singularity build fastqc-web-0.11.9.sif docker-daemon://fastqcwww
```

### Sandboxing

Instead of generating an image file, it is actually possible to use a whole directory with its contents. This is handy when specific changes may be needed.

```{bash}
     singularity build --sandbox ./sandbox docker://ubuntu:18.04
     touch sandbox/etc/myetc.conf
     singularity build sandbox.sif ./sandbox
```

```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
Apart from testing or debugging, as we commented with Docker, we don't recommend this approach because it makes reproducibility more difficult.
```

### Singularity recipes

Singularity provides its own build system and recipe syntax. Despite it is actually possible to generate images from scratch (known as ***bootstraping***) thanks to these recipes, this is at time of writing far slower than converting from Docker ones. Docker has the advantage of saving every action line as a cached image. That is not happening with Singularity.

When using recipes, it's mandatory to have administrator permissions (e.g., as beeing root or via **sudo**).

In any case, it can still be useful to boostrap an image derived from a previously existing one. Below we provide two common approaches:


#### Docker bootstrap

Instead of converting a Docker image into a Singularity one, it's possible to use one as a base one and modify it by using Singularity recipe syntax.

````
BootStrap: docker
From: biocontainers/fastqc:v0.11.9_cv7

%runscript
    echo "Welcome to FastQC Image"
    fastqc --version

%post
    echo "Image built"
````

```{bash}
    sudo singularity build fastqc.sif docker.singularity
```

```{block2, type='rmdtip'}
The command %runscript would be equivalent to ENTRYPOINT/CMD in Docker. It is only triggered when using ```singularity run```. This is useful if you want to hide from the user the complexity of a command-line path or an included custom script.
```
```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
There are other bootstraping options, such as debootstrap: https://wiki.debian.org/singularity
```

```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
It's possible to sign cryptographically your images, so third parties can verify they are coming from their actual authors. This implies some matters beyond the scope of this course, but you have some details if interested at: https://singularity.hpcng.org/user-docs/3.7/signNverify.html
```

## Run and execution process

Once we have some image files (or directories) ready, we can run or favourite processes.

### Singularity shell

The straight-forward exploratory approach, equivalent to ```docker run -ti myimage /bin/shell```. But with a more handy syntax.

```{bash}
    singularity shell fastqc-multi-bowtie.sif
```

```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
Move around the directories and notice the different isolation approach compared to Docker. You can access most of the host filesystem.
```

### Singularity exec

That is the most common way to execute Singularity (equivalent to ```docker exec```). That would be the normal approach in HPC environments.

```{bash}
    singularity exec fastqc-multi-bowtie.sif fastqc
```

### Singularity run

This executes runscript from recipe definition (equivalent to ```docker run```). Not so common for HPC uses. More for instances (servers).

```{bash}
    singularity run fastqc-multi-bowtie.sif
```

### Environment control

By default Singularity inherits our profile environment (e.g., PATH environment variable). This may be convenient for some circumstances, but it can also lead to unexpected problems if you are not aware, when your own environment clashes with the default one from the image.

```{bash}
    singularity shell -e fastqc-multi-bowtie.sif

    singularity exec -e fastqc-multi-bowtie.sif fastqc

    singularity run -e fastqc-multi-bowtie.sif
```

Compare ```env``` command with and without -e modifier.

```{bash}
    singularity exec fastqc-multi-bowtie.sif env
    singularity exec -e fastqc-multi-bowtie.sif env
```

### Execute from sandboxed images / directories

```{bash}
    singularity exec ./sandbox ls -l /etc/myetc.conf
    # We can see file created in the directory before
    singularity exec ./sandbox bash -c 'apt-get update && apt-get install python'
    # We cannot install python
    singularity exec --writable ./sandbox bash -c 'apt-get update && apt-get install python'
    # We needed to add writable parameter
```

### Execute straight from a registry

Image is actually downloaded (and if a Docker one, converted) and stored in Singularity cache directory.

```{bash}
    singularity exec docker://ncbi/blast:2.10.1 blastp -version
```

## Bind paths (aka volumes)

Paths of host system mounted in the container

* Default ones, no need to mount them explicitly (for 3.7.x): ```$HOME``` , ```/sys:/sys``` , ```/proc:/proc```, ```/tmp:/tmp```, ```/var/tmp:/var/tmp```, ```/etc/resolv.conf:/etc/resolv.conf```, ```/etc/passwd:/etc/passwd```, and ```$PWD``` [https://singularity.hpcng.org/user-docs/3.7/bind_paths_and_mounts.html](https://singularity.hpcng.org/user-docs/3.7/bind_paths_and_mounts.html)

For others, need to be done explicitly (syntax: host:container)

```{bash}
    mkdir testdir
    touch testdir/testout
    singularity shell -e -B ./testdir:/scratch fastqc-multi-bowtie.sif
    > touch /scratch/testin
    > exit
    ls -l testdir
```

## Example execution:

Using the 2 fastqc available files, process them outside and inside the mounted directory.

Let's use our ```fastqc.sif``` image file and we place it in $HOME

```{bash}
# Let's create a dummy directory
mkdir $HOME/scratch

# Let's copy contents of testdata in scratch

singularity exec fastqc.sif fastqc scratch/*fastq.gz

# Check you have some HTMLs there. Remove them
rm scratch/*html

# Let's use shell
singularity shell fastqc.sif
> cd scratch
> fastqc *fastq.gz
> exit

# Check you have some HTMLs there. Remove them
singularity exec -B ./scratch:/fastqcdir fastqc.sif fastqc /fastqcdir/*fastq.gz

# What happens here!
singularity exec -B ./scratch:/fastqcdir fastqc.sif bash -c 'fastqc /fastqcdir/*fastq.gz'

```

## Instances

Also know as **services**. Despite Docker it is still more convenient for these tasks, it allows enabling thing such as webservices (e.g., via APIs) in HPC workflows. Instead of defining a **%runscript** block, we define a **%startscript** one. So, it would be possible to have both if needed.

Simple example:

```
Bootstrap: docker
From: library/mariadb:10.3

%startscript
        mysqld
```

```{bash}
    sudo singularity build mariadb.sif mariadb.singularity

    mkdir -p testdir
    mkdir -p testdir/db
    mkdir -p testdir/socket

    singularity exec -B ./testdir/db:/var/lib/mysql mariadb.sif mysql_install_db

    singularity instance start -B ./testdir/db:/var/lib/mysql -B ./testdir/socket:/run/mysqld mariadb.sif mydb

    singularity instance list

    singularity exec instance://mydb mysql -uroot

    singularity instance stop mydb
```

```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
When exposing ports below 1024 in a LINUX machine, administrator (sudo) privileges are needed. Historical reference: https://www.w3.org/Daemon/User/Installation/PrivilegedPorts.html
```

```{block2, type='rmdtip'}
Specially with instances (**but not only**), if you encounter some permission problems you may need to enable write permissions in the image. If you do not want changes to persist in the image, you may want to use the **--writable-tmpfs option**. Changes are stored in an in-memory temporary filesystem which is discarded as soon as the service stops. More details about special storage options with Singularity: https://singularity.hpcng.org/user-docs/3.7/persistent_overlays.html
```

## Troubleshooting

```{bash}
     singularity --help
```

### Fakeroot

Singularity permissions are an evolving field. If you don't have access to ```sudo```, it might be worth considering using ``--fakeroot/-f`` parameter.

* More details at [https://singularity.hpcng.org/user-docs/3.7/fakeroot.html](https://singularity.hpcng.org/user-docs/3.7/fakeroot.html)

### Singularity cache directory

    $HOME/.singularity

* It stores cached images from registries, instances, etc.
* If problems may be a good place to clean. When running ```sudo```, $HOME is /root.

### Global singularity configuration

Normally at ```/etc/singularity/singularity.conf``` or similar (e.g preceded by ```/usr/local/``` is Singularity is installed manually)

* It can only be modified by users with administration permissions
* Worth noting ```bind path``` lines, which point default mounted directories in containers as commented in [bind paths section][Bind paths (aka volumes)]

Compare with the previous Docker examples

First of all, let's generate a ```blast.sif``` image. We have plenty of ways to do this. One example below:

```{bash}
singularity build blast.sif docker://ncbi/blast:2.10.1
```

### Blast command-line (1)

```{bash}
# If not there create a DB dir
mkdir $HOME/db

cp blast.sif $HOME/db

cd $HOME/db

curl -L https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O75976.fasta -o O75976.fasta

curl -L https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q90240.fasta -o Q90240.fasta

singularity exec blast.sif blastp -query O75976.fasta -subject Q90240.fasta

# We can mount if we prefer (as we did with Docker), but it's not strictly necessary
singularity exec -B /home/ec2-user/db:/blastdb blast.sif blastp -query /blastdb/O75976.fasta -subject /blastdb/Q90240.fasta > out.blast

singularity exec -B /home/ec2-user/db:/blastdb blast.sif blastp -query /blastdb/O75976.fasta -subject /blastdb/Q90240.fasta -out /blastdb/output.blast
```

### Blast command-line (2)

```{bash}
# If not there create a DB dir
mkdir $HOME/db

cp blast.sif $HOME/db

cd $HOME/db

# Let's download Swissprot DB
curl -L https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/swissprot.gz -o swissprot.gz

gunzip swissprot.gz

# Let format the Swissprot DB
singularity exec blast.sif makeblastdb -dbtype prot -parse_seqids -in swissprot
```

We can retrieve a FASTA sequence by ID

```{bash}
singularity exec blast.sif blastdbcmd -dbtype prot -db swissprot -entry O75976
```
